Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed 
for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

EC2 web application security group had INBOUND SSH enabled from internet. This can be restricted to
specific source IP addresses or a Bastion host can be used.

AWS Config also reports NACL is open on port 22

Remediate with Network security practices, 
- restrict SSH using IP filtering
- Create a bastion host with instance in private subnet
- Change default port from 22 to something above 1024
- Use Instance identity as part of Privilege access
- Use AWS Inspector to detect port vulnerability
