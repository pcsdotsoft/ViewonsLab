# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1. Use a bastion host in public subnet with restricted access to app instance in private subnet
2. Use MFA solution like tailscale.com for SSH connections
3. Use SSH PKI public key authentication
4. Remove SSH service and create immutable instances

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 
prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
VPC private endpoint is service for secure access to S3 from specified VPC. If attack instance is part of same VPC
it will be ineffective to prevent unauthorized access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
It will not encrypt existing objects by default.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It will check the drift and restore changes made
