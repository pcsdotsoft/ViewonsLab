# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
1. Open Policy agent Regula
2. cfn-nag

### Example vulnerability
Regula has a rule library for most AWS resources, e.g. ebs encryption rule. It evaluates for that compliance
requirement to keep ebs encrypted. If Terraform plan attempts to create a unencrypted ebs it will block deployment

cfn-nag is a static analysis tool to analyze cloudformation templates for more than 140 vulnerabilities. e.g. It scans for
Least Use Privilege and reports misuse of "*" wildcard in "Action" or "Resource" in IAM policies of CFN template.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
1. Amazon Inspector for EC2 AMI scans
2. Trivy for Docker and Kubernetes

### Example vulnerability
Amazon Inspector scans for CVEs, the report provides a CVE id for e.g. CVE-2018-7600 which is a Remote code execution vulnerability, 
Report also indicates Severity ratings.

Trivy enalbes CVE report finding in Docker images, it will also scan directories for project dependencies having vulnerabilities


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
1. AWS Config
2. Amazon Macie

### Example vulnerability
AWS config can be set for compliance check of Industry standards. It allows specific Config rules to scan for e.g. to follow
"Operational Best Practices for NIST 800-53 rev 4" standard

Amazon Macie is a Data security and vulnerability scanner, it will provide visibility into data security risks. For e.g 
if S3 bucket data policy of sensitive data is violated it provides severity rating of data. It reports appropriate 
data finding remediation to minimize S3 exposure.
